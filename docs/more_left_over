# Project Scope
This project comprises an exploratory statistical investigation of
pressure - stressor relationships utilising the water quality data
underpinning the Darwin Harbour (Water Quality) Report Card as a first
step toward attribution. The driving question behind the study is what
if any of the myriad of pressures show relationships.

## Primary point data

The word file provides point-source TN, TP, TSS and VSS loads to the
Harbour at various scales from 2011-12 to 2020-21. I thinks this
should be self-explanatory.  The excel sheet provide the underlying
data.

## Estimated resident population (ERP) and gross regional product (GRP) 

Estimated resident population (ERP) and gross regional product (grp)
data from 2000-01 to 2021-21 are in the summary data tab. The calcs
data shows the breakdown of data for Wider Darwin LGAs. I have been
watching for updates for the 2021-22 financial year but none so far.

### Get data
```{r get data ERP, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
```

### Glimpse data

```{r glimpse ERP, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}

## Catchment ERP

This dataset gives population density data for 2016 to 2020 (year
ending June 30), including for sub-catchment areas. It will be updated
in March for 2021 and 2022 but you will probably be finished by then.

### Get data
```{r get data catchmentERP, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}

## Fire frequency

This datasets provides fire frequencies for five year windows from
2000-04 until 2017-21. The data are based on weighted averages (WA)
for the individual sub-catchments and the overall catchment
area. Standard deviations (SDs) are also provided. I should be able to
update this dataset for 2018-22 in December when all fire activity
should have stopped.

Lynda subsequently provided the 2018-2022 data

## Fire areas

A mixture of worksheets that provide fire scar areas as km2 and
percentages of the total catchment areas from 2000 to 2021. The data
are also broken down according to whether or not they formed in early
dry-season and late dry-season. Totals comprise early+late firescars.

## Temperature/Rainfall/Anomaly

There are a lot of different spreadsheets in this workbook including:

- Annual total rainfall at Darwin airport (calendar) – 1902-2021
- Monthly rainfall at Darwin airport– 1989 -2022
- Annual rainfall (financial year) – 1989-90 – 2021-22
- Rainfall anomaly – 1902-2021
- Mean air temperature – 1910-2020
- Mean temperature anomaly – 1910 – 2020
- Maximum air temperature – 1910 – 2020
- Maximum temperature anomaly – 1910-2020
- Monthly SOI (Southern Oscillation Index) – 1989 -2022
- Annual averages of monthly SOI for financial years and calendar
  years
- A long SOI record, from 1876
- Sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly – 1900 – 2021

Most of the data are from Darwin airport or gauging station.

You should definitely include annual rainfall and SOI data in your
analyses. Rainfall anomalies and SSTs may also be interesting.

## Building activity

These are the costs of total, engineering, residential and
non-residential building activity from 1987-88 to 2021-22. I realise
they imperfectly relate to built-up area, which increased by ~40%
between 2008 and 2016, and then remained relatively
unchanged. However, periods of major growth are likely to be times of
higher generalised pressures.

# Lookup tables

Although each of the data collections provide a (spatio) temporal
series, they are not all on the same spatial and temporal scales.
Furthermore, whilst the stressor indicators (water quality samples)
are collected within the Darwin Harbour water bodies, most (if not
all) of the pressures are measured from the adjoining sub-catchments
or else were recorded at the scale of the entire harbour.

To be able to relate stressors to pressures, it is necessary to
combine the multiple data sources together which in turn necessitates
finding common scales (both temporal and spatial) in which all
datasets can be projected.

Since many of the provided pressures are on a annual financial year
scale, this scale is used as the common temporal scale across all data
sets.  For the spatial scale, Darwin Harbour Zones are used as these
are the major spatial unit for the Darwin Harbour Water Quality Report
Card.

The following sub-sections provide a series of lookup tables that are
used to map variables from each data set to the common spatial scales,
provide reporting units and provide some analysis settings.

::: panel-tabset

## Measures lookup

This lookup provides a mapping between the original pressure/stressor
names (`Var`) and more convenient (shorter) working versions
(`Measure`) from each `Dataset`.  There are also some additional data
managment settings associated with each data type.

```{r get data var_lookup, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
```
```{r measures lookup, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
readRDS(file = paste0(DATA_PATH, "processed/var_lookup.RData")) %>%
    mutate(Var = str_replace_all(Var,"\\$","\\\\$")) %>%
    knitr::kable(escape = FALSE)
```

## Units lookup

This lookup defines the units (and thus figure/table labels) for each
of the pressure/stressors.

```{r get data units_lookup, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
```
```{r units lookup, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
readRDS(file = paste0(DATA_PATH, "processed/units_lookup.RData")) %>%
 mutate(Units = str_replace_all(Units,"\\$","\\\\$"),
        TableLabel = str_replace_all(TableLabel,"\\$","\\\\$"),
		FigureLabel = str_replace_all(FigureLabel,"\\$","\\\\$")) %>% 
 knitr::kable(escape = FALSE)
```

## Spatial lookup

This lookup defines the Darwin Harbour Water Zone hierarchy.

```{r get data spatial_lookup, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
```
```{r spatial lookup, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
readRDS(file = paste0(DATA_PATH, "processed/spatial_lookup.RData")) %>%
 knitr::kable(escape = FALSE)
```

## Spatial sub-catchments lookup

This lookup defines the Darwin Harbour sub-catchments and maps these
to Darwin Harbour Water Zones.  There are also additional settings
that can be used in the preparation of maps. Note, the spelling of
`Michett Creek` and `Leichhardt Creek`.  This is the spelling provided
in the Darwin Harbour shapefiles, however the spellings are different
in the various excel spreadsheets.  I have opted to honour the
spellings in the shapefiles.

```{r get data spatial_subcatchments_lookup, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
```
```{r spatial subcatchments lookup, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
readRDS(file = paste0(DATA_PATH, "processed/spatial_subcatchments_lookup.RData")) %>%
 knitr::kable(escape = FALSE)
```

## Primary point spatial lookup

This lookup provides settings that can be used in the preparation of
maps for the primary point data.

```{r get data spatial_lookup_primary, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
```
```{r spatial lookup primary, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
readRDS(file = paste0(DATA_PATH, "processed/spatial_lookup_primary.RData")) %>%
 knitr::kable(escape = FALSE)
```

## Catchment ERP spatial lookup

This lookup provides a mapping between the catchment names supplied in
the `Catchment ERP` data and the standardised names used across all
datasets. Note, the spelling of `Michett Creek` and `Leichhardt
Creek`.

```{r get data spatial_lookup_catchment_erp, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
```
```{r spatial lookup catchment_erp, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
readRDS(file = paste0(DATA_PATH, "processed/spatial_lookup_catchment_erp.RData")) %>%
 knitr::kable(escape = FALSE)
```

## Fire frequency spatial lookup
This lookup provides a mapping between the catchment names supplied in
the `FireFreq` data and the standardised names used across all
datasets.  Note, the spelling of `Michett Creek` and `Leichhardt
Creek`.

```{r get data spatial_lookup_fire, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
```
```{r spatial lookup fire, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
readRDS(file = paste0(DATA_PATH, "processed/spatial_lookup_fire.RData")) %>%
 knitr::kable(escape = FALSE)
```

## Fire areas spatial lookup
This lookup provides a mapping between the catchment names supplied in
the `FireAreas` data and the standardised names used across all
datasets.  Note, the spelling of `Michett Creek` and `Leichhardt
Creek`.

```{r get data spatial_lookup_fire_areas, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
```
```{r spatial lookup fire areas, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
readRDS(file = paste0(DATA_PATH, "processed/spatial_lookup_fire_areas.RData")) %>%
 knitr::kable(escape = FALSE)

### 2016-2022

The 2016-2022 data contain both `Discrete` and `CFM` (Continuous Flow
Management) data.  I am not sure that I understand the distinction.
Initially I thought that `Discrete` data were collected via
individual, manual grab samples at specific locations repeatedly on an
annual schedule.  However, given the very large number of Discrete
samples in 2018, it is unlikely that this description is completely
accurate.

Whilst the relatively small number of discrete sampling locations does
mean that the estimates are biased towards the sampling locations
(that is, they are not necessarily fully representative of the entire
Zone from which they are collected), this design does make it easier
to detect temporal trends (since the bias remains relatively constant
over time) for a given sampling effort.

By contrast, `CFM` data are collected via a system that draws water
samples at regular intervals, analyses them and couples the with a GPS
for geocoding. These data are not necessarily replicated over time and
thus, whilst potentially more spatially representative, if not
replicated annually, the biases in estimates will fluctuate and
potentially mask temporal trends.

Since the purpose of this study is to relate temporal trends in the
pressures and stressors, it is more appropriate to work primarily with
the discrete data.

Issues:

- there are a large number of records without Latitude/Longitude.
  These are all `CFM` values.  I could either exclude them, or else
  give them Lat/Longs
- concernedly, there are 54 records in which the Latitude and
  Longitude values are clearly swapped around.  These all occur in the
  2017 data.
- in the 2016 data, there are some `CFM` records that have
  Latitude/Longitude values of "too_big" and thus NA - I will exclude
  these
- in the 2018 data, there are a large number of `Discrete` records
  that seem to be `CFM` (they appear in transects).  This is going to
  make it difficult to filter out all the `CFM` data.
- there are a few examples in which the spatial hierarchy seems to
  break down.  That is, there are Zones in Regions they should not be
  in.  E.g. Zone 1 (Outer Harbour) should be in the "Outer" Region.
  However, there are records in the input data in which there are Zone
  1, "Inner" Region. 


Processing steps:

- attempt to correct the Latitude values that are stored as longitudes
  and vice verse.
- attempt to recode and "Discrete" `Source` values that have "CFM"
  `SAMPTYPE` as "Discrete"
- format date
- pivot longer according to the focal response variables
- provide short names for response variables
- to prevent issues of joining based on the spatial hierarchy
  inconsistencies (with Region), I will remove the `Region` field
  prior to join.
- provide spatial context

```

The following is supposed to be purely "Discrete" samples, but I am
struggling to come up with the logic to support this given the issues
describe above.  There are clearly still "CFM" samples present in
2018.

### 2018 alterations

These data are purely 2018 samples that have been more curated (by
Julia Fortune).  They are processed here the same as the 2016-2022
data.  It is clear that these 'discrete' samples still do not always
represent samples collected at discrete (and repeatedly sampled)
stations.

### Routine sites

To help identify samples that would be considered routine from those
that are temporally unique (such as those collected via some sort of
underway system, Julia Fortune has provided a list of the routine
sites (along with there Lat/Longs).

### Combine data

- row bind 2012-2015 and 2016-2022 data sets together
- add additional spatial information (such as Area, Region and Zone
  Names)
- pivot the data wider to express each response in their own column

Note, when pivoting, it was necessary to aggregate duplicates (means).
There were instances in which there were multiple Values for the same
response at the same time and location.  For example, there are two
Chlorophyll-a values (11.570 and 9.780) sampled on 07/07/2014 at
location (131.0372, -12.38608).  These records are on rows 80 and 2454
of the original `2014.csv` input file.

## Primary point data

<!--
Questions for Lynda:

1. Why are there missing lat/longs?
2. Why are there missing Catchment values?
3. Why dont the values in Catchment match those in the other datasets
   and the shapefiles?
4. To relate these data to the water quality data, there needs to be a
   way to align the two data sets spatially.  Given that they primary
   point data are collected at different locations to the water
   quality data, I will need some other form of spatial association.
   For example, I could align them according to Zone.  However, as
   many of the primary point data are collected outside of the Zones,
   I would have to have a lookup table to assign Zones to the primary
   point observations.  Although I could just base it on which Zone
   they are closest to, this might not be the most appropriate.  For
   example, the primary point data includes a field `Recieving zone`
   that has values of either `Inner` or `Outer` - however `Woods Inlet` 
   would be most closely aligned with `Central Harbour` if I
   was to assign based on closeness...  I could simply use `Inner` and
   `Outer`, but these seem very course...  Any thoughts?
-->

Processing steps:

- correct spelling of `Site` of "Territory Generation DP1" to
  "Territory Generation ADP1"
- format date of year end
- there are duplicate values (multiple values collected on same
  date/site - these are all Waste Discharge Licence) - I will remove
  this category as it is not really a Parameter
- many of the fields in this dataset are superfluous or not fit for
  the current purpose (some because the fields are inconsistent).  I
  will remove all but `Site`, `Year`, `Load`, `Parameter`, `Latitude`
  and `Longitude`.
- use a lookup table to fill in lat/longs that are missing in the
  data.  The lookup table has lat/longs supplied via email by Lynda.
- provide spatial context (in the form of `Catchement` and `ZoneName`)
  by joining these data to sub-catchment spatial data.
- pivot wider so that `Parameters` are in new fields
- rename parameters so that they are easier to work with
- reorder the spatial data according to Catchment number

Additional problems that are no longer an issue:

  - there is at least one instance where `Source of discharge` differs
    for the same `Site`, `Fin Year`, `Year ref`, Lat/Long,
    `Organisation` - how is this possible.  I am going to remove the
    "Source of discharge" field as this inconsistency is problematic.
  - `Financial year end` and `Year ref.` are not consistent with
    `Financial year end` - see example rows 282:285 of `Primary Point
    Source Dataset_22.xlsx`.  I am going to remove `Financial year
    end`

## Estimated resident population (ERP) and gross regional product (GRP) 

Processing steps:

- rename parameters so that they are easier to work with

These data do not have any spatial context, and thus will be applied
at the whole of harbour level.

## Catchment ERP

Questions for Lynda:

1. Should `MWA` be `Central Harbour` or `West Arm`, should they be
   combined or should they be repeated so that the `ERP` and `Pop`
   values effect both `West Arm` and `Central Harbour` water quality
   values
2. There are numerous apparent '-' in the excel sheet.  Some of these
   (e.g. H6 are actually a '-'). Others, are exported as zero (0)
   because they are right justified (e.g, D6-H6) and therefore
   considered a negative rather than a nulll.  Should they be 0 or -?
3. This results in 0 values for the population columns
4. `Darwin CBD` is listed as `East Arm`, to be consistent, shouldn't
   this be `Central Harbour`

Processing steps:

- remove the row sums
- replace `-` characters with NA
- ensure that all variables that begin with a four digit year are considered numeric
- pivot longer so that the main predictors are in a single column
- remove any rows with Value of NA
- separete the column into Year and Predictor
- pivot wider according to Predictor
- rename parameters so that they are easier to work with

## Fire frequency

Data issues:

- There are two columns called "11-15 (WA)".  As a result, when
    imported, numbers are appended. Based on the naming patterns of
    the other columns, it is clear that the second of these "11-15
    (WA)" columns should have been "11-15 (SD)". Fix this up 
- There is also some inconsistency in the format of the column
    names.  Most of them are of the format "YR1_YR2 (STAT)", however,
    the final few columns are of the format "YR1_YR2 STAT" (that is,
    no brackets) - fix this.

Processing steps:

- rename the errant columns
- remove the Overall summation row
- pivot the table longer such that each year is a separate row
- the input data represent the weighted averages and standard
  deviations over 5 year windows.  For these data to be useful in an
  statistical analysis, we need to express this time range as a single
  year.  I will take the last year of the range of years as the focal
  Year.  The logic here is that the fire frequency has been
  experienced over that 5 year period.
- pivot wider to express both weighted average and standard deviation
  versions as separate predictors

## Combine all data

In combining together the responses/stresses along with the pressures,
it is important to recognise that they are collected on different
spatial and temporal scales.  Hence, to combine all the sources
together, we need to do so via common spatial and temporal scales.

For temporal scales, it is simple enough to base this on the financial
year since most of the data are already expressed this way, or else
the conversions are simple enough.  However, the spatial scales are
more difficult, particularly considering that the water quality data
(stresses) are collected in water and the pressures are predominantly
collected terrestrially. The only real way to address this is to be
able to associate each of the _Sub-catchments_ to a single harbour
_Zone_.

Consequently, all analyses will be conducted on the Zone/Year scale.
There are many instances (both stresses and pressures) in which there
are multiple observations collected per Zone/Year. As a result, when
the multiple sources are combined together, the number of data set
rows will increase dramatically.  For example, a given water quality
observation might appear multiple times, once for each pressure
observation at that Zone/Year scale.

This duplication is not necessarily an issue, however, we need to be
mindful of it so as to prevent it from artificially over or under
weighting some effects.  To help with this, I will add a unique record
identifier to the water quality components.

The alternative is to aggregate all data to the Zone/Year level such
that there are no more than one observation (per stress and
predictor) per Zone/Year. Although this would simplify things, it has
the potential to loose vast quantities of information.

Note, in the following plots, pressures are expressed in Zone
aggregations rather than Catchments so that they can be aligned with
the responses (stressors).  Also notes that the temporal range of
pressures is truncated to match that of the maximum temporal domain of

## Associations

Relating two time series is a difficult statistical challenge.  In
order to establish that the covariance amongst two time series is
causal and not simply correlated (due to both being correlated to
other influences), it is necessary to remove the temporal component.
For example, two time series might both appear to increase linearly
over time.  This may be because one of the variables genuinely does
impact on the other.  However, it is also possible that they are both
responding to similar underlying influences.  Removing the temporal
element, means that the associations are concentrating on the smaller
perturbations rather than the overall trends.

To remove the temporal element, each time series can be transformed
into differences between successive observations.  Such a
transformation will result in time series that fluctuate over time.
If the fluctuations of each time series coincide, then it is more
likely that the associations are correlative.

Unfortunately, for this transformation to be useful, it is necessary
for both time series to be regular (uniformly spaced out sampling
intervals with no missing values) or at least identically irregular -
neither of which apply to the current data series.  Alternatively, if
the time series were sufficiently long (20+ years), non-parametric
spline models could be fit to reconstruct estimates of the full time
series from which to sample at regular time intervals to achieve a
similar analysis.  Unfortunately again this option is not available
for these data due to the relatively short time span of the
data. Consequently, we can only explore simple models that explore the
relationships between the time series and acknowledge that any
inferred relationships may well be artefacts.

## Dual time series plots

Note, in the following plots, pressures are expressed in Zone
aggregations rather than Catchments so that they can be aligned with
the responses (stressors).  Also notes that the temporal range of
pressures is truncated to match that of the maximum temporal domain of
the stressors data.

## Pressures
See the plots in the Exploratory data analyses (Discrete samples) section.

## Dual time series plots

Note, in the following plots, pressures are expressed in Zone
aggregations rather than Catchments so that they can be aligned with
the responses (stressors).  Also notes that the temporal range of
pressures is truncated to match that of the maximum temporal domain of
the stressors data.

## Associations

Relating two time series is a difficult statistical challenge.  In
order to establish that the covariance amongst two time series is
causal and not simply correlated (due to both being correlated to
other influences), it is necessary to remove the temporal component.
For example, two time series might both appear to increase linearly
over time.  This may be because one of the variables genuinely does
impact on the other.  However, it is also possible that they are both
responding to similar underlying influences.  Removing the temporal
element, means that the associations are concentrating on the smaller
perturbations rather than the overall trends.

To remove the temporal element, each time series can be transformed
into differences between successive observations.  Such a
transformation will result in time series that fluctuate over time.
If the fluctuations of each time series coincide, then it is more
likely that the associations are correlative.

Unfortunately, for this transformation to be useful, it is necessary
for both time series to be regular (uniformly spaced out sampling
intervals with no missing values) or at least identically irregular -
neither of which apply to the current data series.  Alternatively, if
the time series were sufficiently long (20+ years), non-parametric
spline models could be fit to reconstruct estimates of the full time
series from which to sample at regular time intervals to achieve a
similar analysis.  Unfortunately again this option is not available
for these data due to the relatively short time span of the
data. Consequently, we can only explore simple models that explore the
relationships between the time series and acknowledge that any
inferred relationships may well be artefacts.
